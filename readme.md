Welcome to Pokedex. This app is an index of all 151 pokemon from the original series. All data used for this app comes from a mock api file that I created. The actual data itself comes from various pokemon sites.

To run the app:

1. clone repo into new directory

2. 'cd' into directory

3. 'npm install' to install dependencies

4. visit localhost:3000 to view app once webpack bundle is valid

Have fun increasing your pokemon knowledge!
